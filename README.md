# Generating of Starting Points (before running of model)
# Starting Point Generation Codes

The `Starting_point_generation_codes` folder contains scripts used to generate initial points for subzones in Singapore. These points help facilitate car park placement model analysis.

## How to Run the Scripts

### Dependencies
Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
- `pandas`
- `folium`
- `shapely`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `openpyxl` (for Excel file handling)
- `numpy` (for Poisson Disk Sampling, if applicable)

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas folium shapely beautifulsoup4 openpyxl numpy
```
## Directory Structure

### Dataset Folder
The `Dataset` folder contains the following:
- **Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) (GEOJSON).geojson** – GeoJSON file defining subzone boundaries.
- **Singapore Residents by Planning Area, Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, Jun 2024.xlsx** – Original population dataset.
- **extract-population-subzone.py** – Python script for cleaning and filtering the population data by subzone.
- **SG_Population_Data_2024.xlsx** – Output generated by `extract-population-subzone.py`, containing cleaned subzone population data.

### Starting_point_generation_codes Folder
The `Starting_point_generation_codes` folder contains:
- **starting_points_results** – Directory to store all output files generated by the different starting point generation scripts.
- **starting_points_with_population** – Directory to store merged outputs of population data and generated starting points.
- **Centroid-Calculation.py** – Script to generate a single centroid per subzone.
- **poisson-disk-sampling-start-points-calculation.py** – Script to create evenly spaced starting points using Poisson Disk Sampling.
- **random-start-points-calculation.py** – Script to generate multiple random starting points within each subzone.

## Running the Scripts
Each script generates starting points using different approaches:
  -  Centroid-Calculation.py – Generates one centroid per subzone.
  -  random-centroid-calculation.py – Creates a defined number of random points within each subzone.
  -  poisson-disk-sampling-centroid-calculation.py – Ensures evenly spaced points using Poisson Disk Sampling for better distribution.

Run the scripts from the `Starting_point_generation_codes` directory with:
```bash
python Centroid-Calculation.py
python random-centroid-calculation.py
python poisson-disk-sampling-centroid-calculation.py
```
## Starting Points Outputs
  -  Each script saves an HTML map visualizing the generated points.
  -  Corresponding Excel files containing the generated points data.
  -  Merged Excel files with subzone points and population data for further analysis.


# Optimisation Model (Backend)
## Dependencies
You will need the following dependencies to run this project:
- Python
- Python Virtual Environment (virtualenv)

After installing the dependencies on your system, create a new virtual
environment and activate it:
```sh
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

When you've activated it succesfully, you can run the following command to
install the python dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

When you have installed the dependencies, you can run the following command to
start the backend server:
```sh
python model.py
```
